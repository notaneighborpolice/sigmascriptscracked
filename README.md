# SexyScript

An abismally organized recoil script for rust, created with a friend for fun. This is not properly done, but it is one of the few public C++ recoil scripts supporting most/all guns with a gui. The overlay is trash, and I know that, don't confront me about it.

# Features

 - Automatic sensitivity and FOV detection for calibration
 - A nice ingame HUD that shows you what you have selected
 - A weapon cycler with keybinds to quickly switch between weapons

# Can I get banned?

After being present on unknowncheats for a very long time, this was never detected. Just VMP it and you should be fine. Most scripts are detected from EAC employees manually adding the script signatures to the detection database.

# Problems

- May not work properly on certain computers for unknown/unclear reasons (the timer can be made more accurate for firing)
- Very bad overlay that lags a lot

# Improvements

- Utilization of PostWindowMessage
- More accurate timing scheme
